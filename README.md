# EQporoelasticity
Solves coupled set of poroelastic equations for subduction zone events (EQ's, slow slip, subduction)

The plotting codes can be buggy depending on what you are trying to do. Most functions work well with the outputs of the model, but some shortcuts were hardcoded to generate figures and haven't been fixed yet. I'll clean them up eventually.
